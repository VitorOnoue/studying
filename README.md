# studying

This repo is where I post some of what I've learned so far.

+ DataStructure directory: contains some Java codes I took notes from my Data Structure subject in college and the two projects of the semester.

+ AlgorithmAnalysis directory: contains a single C file. It is a college task that should solve a problem similar to the Knapsack problem. The goal was to use recursion, which was what the class was learning at the time.

+ PythonLibraries directory: as the name suggests, contains notes/codes of my learning in Python libraries (Numpy, Matplotlib), to further develop my knowledge in AI.
